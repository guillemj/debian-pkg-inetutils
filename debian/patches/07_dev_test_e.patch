Description:
 While testing paths, ./configure uses test -r to check for those who
 are not provided by system headers.  However, this does not work for
 root-only files.  On hurd-i386 for instance, /dev/klog is only root
 readable, so the test fails, and thus inetutils-syslogd doesn't fill
 /dev/kern.log. ./configure should use test -e instead.
