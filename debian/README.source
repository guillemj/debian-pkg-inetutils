This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source. Please refer to /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source for more
information.

There's a script to help generating tarballs from CVS snapshots:

	$ debian/tarball.sh snapshot <upstream-tarball>

and to update it:

	$ debian/tarball.sh update
